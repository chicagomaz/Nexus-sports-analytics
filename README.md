# Real-Time Sports Analytics Dashboard

A real-time basketball analytics dashboard built with AWS services and Next.js.

## Architecture

- **Data Ingestion**: Kinesis Data Streams for live game events
- **Processing**: Lambda functions for real-time metrics calculation
- **Storage**: DynamoDB for live stats, S3 for historical data
- **ML**: SageMaker for win probability predictions
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time**: WebSockets via API Gateway
